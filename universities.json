In the early days, many professors were invited from overseas to lecture, and they brought with them new standards of research from Europe. They assisted in transforming USP into a vital driving force for national progress, and, during the first twenty years of its existence, the University established several new schools. Subsequently, the University has expanded both in the quality of its output and in its size, adding the Institute of Biology in São Paulo and the campuses of São Carlos and Ribeirão Preto in the 1950s. Finally, in 1960, in the city of São Paulo, a new University campus, the Cidade Universitária was inaugurated. This resulted in the unification of the majority of the schools and faculties in one location",

The first-ever national University in the Caucasus was opened on 26 January 1918, the day of commemoration of King David the Builder (new style 8 February). Upon the nomination of Ivane Javakhishvili, the Council of Professors elected Petre Melikishvili as the first rector of the university. Ivane Javakhishvili took charge of the faculty of philosophy. Tbilisi State University is one of the largest higher educational institutions in the South Caucasus",

It comprises a federation of central academic bodies, member institutions and research institutes that include world leaders in their fields: Birkbeck, University of London; City, University of London; Courtauld Institute of Art; Goldsmiths, University of London; Institute of Cancer Research; King's College London, London Business School, London School of Economics and Political Science; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Queen Mary University of London; Royal Academy of Music; Royal Central School of Speech and Drama; Royal Holloway, University of London; Royal Veterinary College; School of Advanced Study; School of Oriental and African Studies; St George's, University of London; UCL; and University of London Institute in Paris",
