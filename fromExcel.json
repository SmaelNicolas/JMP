In the early days, many professors were invited from overseas to lecture, and they brought with them new standards of research from Europe. They assisted in transforming USP into a vital driving force for national progress, and, during the first twenty years of its existence, the University established several new schools. Subsequently, the University has expanded both in the quality of its output and in its size, adding the Institute of Biology in São Paulo and the campuses of São Carlos and Ribeirão Preto in the 1950s. Finally, in 1960, in the city of São Paulo, a new University campus, the Cidade Universitária was inaugurated. This resulted in the unification of the majority of the schools and faculties in one location",

It is aimed at contributing to the decentralization of high quality higher education services in the following substantive functions: Teaching, Research, Cultural Diffusion and Development promotion.  The SUNEO Project started in 1988 and at the beginning of 1990, the activities began with the Technological University of the Mixteca (UTM). In 1992, the University of the Sea (UMAR) was created and the project was extended to a new socio- cultural and environmental reference point in Oaxaca: the Oaxacan coast, with the aim of promoting the culture of the sea. During the first decade of the 21st century, the project was extended throughout the state, expanding the educational offerings in the field of science and technology and developing scientific and technological research and creating many services for the people of Oaxaca. SUNEO is made up of ten universities on eighteen campus distributed throughout all regions of Oaxaca. The campus are scalable to meet demand: Technological University of the Mixteca (UTM-Huajuapan), University of the Sea (UMAR-Puerto Escondido, Puerto Ángel, Huatulco and Oaxaca campus), University of the Isthmus (UNISTMO-Tehuantepec, Ixtepec, Juchitán Campus), University of Papaloapan (UNPA- Tuxtepec and Loma Bonita Campus), University of Sierra Sur (UNSIS-Miahuatlán), University of Sierra Juárez (UNSIJ-Ixtlán), University of La Cañada (UNCA-Teotitlán de Flores Magón), NovaUniversitas (Ocotlán, San Jacinto and Juxtlahuaca Campus), University of the Coast (UNCOS- Pinotepa Nacional) and University of Chalcatongo (UNICHA-Chalcatongo de Hidalgo). Additional campus are under construction. At this time, SUNEO has around 1,100 full-time professors. More than 10 thousand students. 30 Research Institutes, 183 Laboratories and 29 Workshops.

It is also the first University to give external students the opportunity to continue to earn a living while studying, and to study privately and take exams without coming to London. Since then, University of London has expanded and modernised, becoming a pioneering institution that was the first to make higher education available to women and those unable to pursue traditional forms of study. Today, UoL has 120,000 students on campuses in London and 50,000 in 190 countries taking UoL degrees transnationally. It comprises a federation of central academic bodies, member institutions and research institutes that include world leaders in their fields: Birkbeck, University of London; City, University of London; Courtauld Institute of Art; Goldsmiths, University of London; Institute of Cancer Research; King's College London, London Business School, London School of Economics and Political Science; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Queen Mary University of London; Royal Academy of Music; Royal Central School of Speech and Drama; Royal Holloway, University of London; Royal Veterinary College; School of Advanced Study; School of Oriental and African Studies; St George's, University of London; UCL; and University of London Institute in Paris",
