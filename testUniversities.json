The newly created Faculty of Philosophy, Languages and Literature, and Human Sciences of the State of São Paulo were integrated along with the schools of Law, Medicine, Engineering, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Education, Economics and Veterinary Medicine as well as Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture. In the early days, many professors were invited from overseas to lecture, and they brought with them new standards of research from Europe. They assisted in transforming USP into a vital driving force for national progress, and, during the first twenty years of its existence, the University established several new schools. Subsequently, the University has expanded both in the quality of its output and in its size, adding the Institute of Biology in São Paulo and the campuses of São Carlos and Ribeirão Preto in the 1950s. Finally, in 1960, in the city of São Paulo, a new University campus, the \"Cidade Universitária\" was inaugurated. This resulted in the unification of the majority of the schools and faculties in one location",
